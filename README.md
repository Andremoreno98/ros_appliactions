Drive omni wheel to a specific point in space
Due to the difference in mechanical operation, the Omniwheel robots cannot be driven like normal robots.
For this project, it was necessary for the robot to maintain the same orientation during the entire movement trajectory. 
In addition, a specific point in space is delivered through Ros Flexbi where the robot must arrive without rotation.
